## Master's Thesis Code Repository


**get_data_functions.py**

* contains function that  gathers S&P 500 stock data with highest trade volume from yahoo finance

**preprocessing_data_helpers.py**

* contains functions that preprocess the data (remove "N/A", standardize data, feature and target generation,...)
	
**main_RF.py**
	
* contains functions that divide the prepared data set into training, validation and test sets and that run "cross validation for time series"
* Bayesian optimization to find the best hyper parameters (number of trees, max depth) for a random forest model (based on average validation loss)
* stores the results of the Bayesian optimization
* stores the best parameters for predicting the target in 20,10,5,3,2,1 trading days 
* uses the best parameters to predict targets of the test sets and stores the results in a data frame containing the date, return, and price information

	Model: features, target and model similiar to

main_LSTM.py 

* contains 2 different models: than can be chosen by the approach variable: 240(model similiar to **), 63 (model similiar to ***)
* contains functions that divide the prepared data set into training, validation and test sets and that run "cross validation for time series"
* Bayesian optimization to find the best hyper parameters (learning rate, hidden layers, lstm nodes, batch size, dropout rate) for a LSTM model (based on average validation loss)	
* stores the results of the Bayesian optimization
* stores the best parameters for predicting the target in 20,10,5,3,2,1 trading days 
* uses the best parameters to predict targets of the test sets and stores the results in a data frame containing the date, return, and price information
